title: Visualising terror attacks in India and around the world.
---

So, one day I was just skimming through kaggle datasets and came across global **terrorism dataset.** I thought it would be very interesting to analyse this dataset and present some visualisations. 

A good amount of data cleaning as well as transformation was required for this analysis. The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2016. I used **plotly library** for creating the visualisations using python.

Now, I will present the visualisations from the analysis.
