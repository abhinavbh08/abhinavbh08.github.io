title: Visualising terror attacks in India and around the world.
---

So, one day I was just skimming through kaggle datasets and came across global terrorism dataset. I thought it would be very interesting to analyse this dataset and present some visualisations. 
A good amount of data cleaning as well as transformation was required for this analysis. The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2016. I used plotly library for creating the visualisations using python. 

```python
x = 123456
```
